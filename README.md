# Weather-Forecasting
This project is a weather forecasting web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to check current weather conditions by entering a city name. The app fetches weather data from an API and displays essential information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions in a user-friendly interface.
